    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="I suspect the victim was poisoned with hemlock. What do you think about that ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Wallace Brown" string="Impossible. This plant causes strong muscle contractions. I would have seen it during the autopsy. Who do you think I am ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="This is the answer I was expecting. Now, if I tell you that the victim used to take opium. Do you still think the same ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Wallace Brown" string="Everything’s changed ! Why didn’t you start by this point ? Now it is possible, it would explain why I didn’t see any contraction during the autopsy. Opium has the property to relax muscles. But it would be needed to mix it in the same solution than the hemlock."></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="That’s what I thought. Thank you for confirming it."></Sentence>

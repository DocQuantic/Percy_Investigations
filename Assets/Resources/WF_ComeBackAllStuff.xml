    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="For you Walter, newspaper and your doughnuts, is it good for you ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="Yes, of course Percy, I knew you’d have come back. As you may know, I’m acquainted with every little gossip of the town. What would you like to know? - he asks with a big smile"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="Could you tell me if Marcus Blayton had some peculiar habits lately ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="Well, it is not really a secret if I told you that Marcus Blayton had quite an unrestrained life. “While money can’t buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own form of misery.”; it perfectly corresponds to his life. People said that you could have found him very often at the brothel on Darty street. A friend of yours manages this place, am I right? - Percy acquiesces. Besides, I was told at a reception that he was maintaining close relations with an odd man around Wood Street, quite a suspicious connection actually…"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="Interesting… How was he with his relatives ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="Some of his friends told me he had an argument with his children about some supposed fortune that he would have made disappear. From what I know, it would be hidden somewhere in London but I don’t know why he would do that. Concerning his wife, everybody knows he was unfaithful. Moreover, I shouldn’t say this to you, but one of my friend saw him in a hotel the day before yesterday in lovely company and she was not his wife ..."></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="Do you know who is this lady, Walter ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="No, I unfortunately don’t. I know she’s a tall blond-haired woman, that’s all... I’d love to know who is lucky enough to have spent a night with the great Marcus Blayton - he laughs."></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="I have a last question for you Walter. What was the overall atmosphere in the troupe ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="I don’t really know. All what I know is that Marcus was a bit of a pig and it didn’t help to make the atmosphere warm during rehearsals. The producer apparently has problems to replenish his pockets. Some say Marcus’ problems are responsible for this, but I ignore what they could be."></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="Thank you Walter, you helped me a lot, once more !"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Walter Fox" string="It’s always my pleasure to discuss with you Percy. I think I spoke too much, once again. - he laughs."></Sentence>

  - When we first met, you looked very angry after Marcus Blayton. Did he owe you
    some money ?
  - "Uh\u2026 It\u2019s possible, yes. I don\u2019t count every penny, you know."
  - "Mr. Hurtley, I think that you don\u2019t realise how serious the situation is.
    It\u2019s a murder case. I suggest you to tell me the truth if you don\u2019t
    want to get into troubles with Scotland Yard."
  - "Ok, it\u2019s true that this guy started to have a huge debt. I kindly reminded
    him to pay me, maybe I was a bit heavy but it was just to scare him, nothing more."

  - "It would be quicker to tell you what wasn\u2019t peculiar with him. But he didn\u2019t
    have unusual habits recently. He still was the man he was. Although Marcus was
    not exactly the Marcus I married."
  - How would you define your relations with Marcus ?
  - "I don\u2019t want to lie. It was really different from what it was at the very
    beginning. When his fame started to grow, he often left on tour, he didn\u2019t
    have time anymore to take care of his family. I think it was at this moment that
    our relation started to deteriorate."

  - Could you analyze this blood sample for me ?
  - It would be a great pleasure but I need to know what to find...
  - I found toxic plants. Could you look for some traces in the blood sample ?

    I\u2019m done."
  - Please.
  - "You were right. I found small quantities of hemlock in the blood. But it\u2019s
    strange. This poison should cause strong muscle contractions, particularly on
    the face. Did you see such a thing on the corpse ?"
  - I should speak to Wallace. Thank you Will !

    him but I finally came to terms with it. Knowing Marcus, I thought it wouldn\u2019t
    have lasted a long time."
  - Even when you learnt that they would leave the city for making a fresh start ?
  - What ? Who told you that ?
  - Your wife told me that you knew everything.
  - How could she inflict this on me ? Oh Rose ...
  - "I must conclude that you didn\u2019t know ?"
  - "No detective, I\u2019m flabbergasted to be honest \u2026 How could they \u2026
    ? I need a moment alone Detective, thank you."

  sentences:
  - I read in newspapers an interview of Marcus Blayton in which he says that the
    company was like a family. Is that true ?
  - "It wasn\u2019t all rosy. The actors don\u2019t feel affection for each other,
    the worst being Messrs Blayton and Norrington. Not a day went by without them
    yelling at each other. Mr Blayton was unpleasant with everyone here but Mrs Pitkins.
    I don\u2019t really know why."
  - You mentioned some animosity between both lead actors. When was their last altercation
    ?
  - I might have heard them arguing yesterday, while other actors were ending the
    rehearsals. It was about an hour before the troupe went to have dinner in town.
  - "You didn\u2019t go with them ?"
  - No, I had to fix the curtain opening mechanism as soon as possible.

    stop going to see my doctor to please Sir Bumpkin ? I truly don\u2019t understand

  - Can you tell me about the ambiance within the troupe?
  - "It wasn\u2019t all rosy. The actors don\u2019t feel affection for each other,
    the worst being Messrs Blayton and Norrington. Not a day went by without them
    yelling at each other. Mr Blayton was unpleasant with everyone here but Mrs Pitkins.
    I don\u2019t really know why."
  - You mentioned some animosity between both lead actors. When was their last altercation
    ?
  - I might have heard them arguing yesterday, while other actors were ending the
    rehearsals. It was about an hour before the troupe went to have dinner in town.
  - "You didn\u2019t go with them ?"
  - No, I had to fix the curtain opening mechanism as soon as possible.

  - "Listen, Marcus was everything but a father to me. What happened to him is a fair
    reward. Marcus was playing with fire. He spent money lavishly and he was pally
    with crooks recently. He was drinking since a couple of years and became violent.
    My mother, my sister and I didn\u2019t recognize him anymore."

  sentences:
  - "Oh good morning detective White, how are you ? It\u2019s been a long time ! I
    think our last meeting dates from your last case, the tailcoats gang case."
  - Haha yes, one of my greatest investigations. - they both laugh.
  - "More seriously, are you in charge of a new one ? Maybe it is about the death
    of Marcus Blayton, isn\u2019t it ?"
  - "You didn\u2019t become a journalist by luck Ms. Barker. Indeed, I\u2019m investigating
    about his mysterious death. I\u2019m coming here in order to know if you have
    informations that I ignore."
  - "Well, you couldn\u2019t find a better place ! I\u2019ve just interviewed Mr.
    Marcus Blayton yesterday morning, on the occasion of the first representation.
    We publish it today, as it was planned, but we didn\u2019t think that it would
    sell that much. The Lord works in mysterious ways."
  - Oh, Is it possible for you to summarise me this interview ? Particularly the informations
    likely to help me ?
  - I will give you all what you need detective White - charming smile. She takes
    the newspaper on her desk. You will find the interview on page 2.
  - Fantastic, thank you Mrs Barker. Could you give me any relevant details about
    this interview that are not mentioned in the newspaper? How did the interview
    go?
  - It was not a simple one !
  - Why that?
  - "Well, he initially wanted to do it in his home, and he also wanted us to give
    him the questions list in advance\u2026 We negotiated: we did it in his home but
    we didn\u2019t give him the questions. The interview was planned to start at 9:30a.m.
    but we had been waiting for one hour and a half with his butler when he finally
    arrived at 11 o\u2019clock."
  - Do you know where he was ?
  - "No I don\u2019t. Nobody knew where he was all night."
  - So you started when he arrived, at 11?
  - "Not exactly\u2026 He wanted a rare and expensive bottle of scotch which he didn\u2019t
    have anymore, he sent his staff to buy one. Finally, we started at noon. But we
    had to be quick because he had a lunch at 1 p.m."
  - Do you know the identity of the person with whom he had lunch ?
  - "I don\u2019t. What I only know is that he was a friend of him."
  - So you started at 12 a.m., right ?
  - "Yes. we discussed half an hour, that\u2019s why the interview is not as long
    as it was planned. Anyway, you\u2019re not here to hear my complains, so I will
    try to give you what you need. Emily has a glance at her notes. I have the feeling
    that everything is said in the interview, except maybe a troubling detail.. When
    I asked \u201CIs it possible to meet again after the last representation ?\u201D
    he answered  that he wouldn\u2019t be available at this time, he didn\u2019t say
    more about the reasons. He added that he would like us to remove this information
    from the interview. It would maybe confirm the suicide hypothesis, except that
    he killed himself at the first representation and not the last one\u2026 What
    do you think detective White ?"
  - "You\u2019re right, this is strange \u2026 I will investigate about this, I thank
    you very much for these informations."
  - "It\u2019s my pleasure M. White, it\u2019s always a pleasure to receive you. Don\u2019t
    wait the next case to come to see me ! - she smiles."
  - he smiles. I certainly will not.

    away from this city. His career, his family, he was ready to abandon everything
    in the name of our love. He even planned to use what remained of his fortune to
    buy a house."
  - His wife and his children must have become angry when they learnt that their legacy
    disappeared, no ?
  - Jane was upset but she finally accepted this situation. On the other hand, I think
    that his son really took it the wrong way.

  sentences:
  - "Oh good morning detective White, how are you ? It\u2019s been a long time ! I
    think our last meeting dates from your last case, the tailcoats gang case."
  - Haha yes, one of my greatest investigations. - they both laugh.
  - "More seriously, are you in charge of a new one ? Maybe it is about the death
    of Marcus Blayton, isn\u2019t it ?"
  - "You didn\u2019t become a journalist by luck Ms. Barker. Indeed, I\u2019m investigating
    about his mysterious death. I\u2019m coming here in order to know if you have
    informations that I ignore."
  - "Well, you couldn\u2019t find a better place ! I\u2019ve just interviewed Mr.
    Marcus Blayton yesterday morning, on the occasion of the first representation.
    We publish it today, as it was planned, but we didn\u2019t think that it would
    sell that much. The Lord works in mysterious ways."
  - Oh, Is it possible for you to summarise me this interview ? Particularly the informations
    likely to help me ?
  - I will give you all what you need detective White - charming smile. She takes
    the newspaper on her desk. You will find the interview on page 2.
  - Fantastic, thank you Mrs Barker. Could you give me any relevant details about
    this interview that are not mentioned in the newspaper? How did the interview
    go?
  - It was not a simple one !
  - Why that?
  - "Well, he initially wanted to do it in his home, and he also wanted us to give
    him the questions list in advance\u2026 We negotiated: we did it in his home but
    we didn\u2019t give him the questions. The interview was planned to start at 9:30a.m.
    but we had been waiting for one hour and a half with his butler when he finally
    arrived at 11 o\u2019clock."
  - Do you know where he was ?
  - "No I don\u2019t. Nobody knew where he was all night."
  - So you started when he arrived, at 11?
  - "Not exactly\u2026 He wanted a rare and expensive bottle of scotch which he didn\u2019t
    have anymore, he sent his staff to buy one. Finally, we started at noon. But we
    had to be quick because he had a lunch at 1 p.m."
  - So you started at 12 a.m., right ?
  - "Yes. we discussed half an hour, that\u2019s why the interview is not as long
    as it was planned. Anyway, you\u2019re not here to hear my complains, so I will
    try to give you what you need. Emily has a glance at her notes. I have the feeling
    that everything is said in the interview, except maybe a troubling detail.. When
    I asked \u201CIs it possible to meet again after the last representation ?\u201D
    he answered  that he wouldn\u2019t be available at this time, he didn\u2019t say
    more about the reasons. He added that he would like us to remove this information
    from the interview. It would maybe confirm the suicide hypothesis, except that
    he killed himself at the first representation and not the last one\u2026 What
    do you think detective White ?"
  - "You\u2019re right, this is strange \u2026 I will investigate about this, I thank
    you very much for these informations."
  - "It\u2019s my pleasure M. White, it\u2019s always a pleasure to receive you. Don\u2019t
    wait the next case to come to see me ! - she smiles."
  - he smiles. I certainly will not.

  - I suspect the victim was poisoned with hemlock. What do you think about that ?

    take opium. Do you still think the same ?
  - "Everything\u2019s changed ! Why didn\u2019t you start by this point ? Now it
    is possible, it would explain why I didn\u2019t see any contraction during the
    autopsy. Opium has the property to relax muscles. But it would be needed to mix
    it in the same solution than the hemlock."
  - "That\u2019s what I thought. Thank you for confirming it."

  - Could you explain me why Marcus had a picture of you in his wallet ?
  - Well, we were close friends since our childhood, we were like brother and sister.
  - "That\u2019s confusing. I\u2019ve found this collection of letters in which the
    person who wrote it was obviously a lady whose initials are R.C. and who seems
    deeply in love with Mr. Blayton as the phrase \u201CSweet love\u201D, by which
    each letter ends, suggests it."
  - Panicked - Where did you find those letters ?
  - So you know they are real ...
  - "Resigned - All right, those letters are from me. Marcus and I loved each other.
    I\u2019ve always been attracted to this man. But our relation became really serious
    a couple of months ago."
  - Why did you hide it from me ?
  - Nobody was aware of this. We wanted to keep it secret in order to hurt less people
    as possible.

  - "Wallace\u2026 In fact I came to know if you\u2019ve performed the autopsy of
    Marcus Blayton. You know, the actor who..."
  - "Yes, I know from whom you\u2019re talking about. His dead body didn\u2019t reveal
    me many things but studying it was fascinating, once more. You will find all what
    you need in my report."
  - Thank you Wallace. What do you think about suicide theory ?
  - "Even if those idiots from Scotland Yard tell it\u2019s a suicide, I think that
    the death is due to something else. Muscles are much more rigid than they should,
    indicating that the death happened before he was hung. Moreover,  after such a
    violent bump, a bruise should appear on the neck but I didn\u2019t find any. Instead,
    I found one on the back of its head dating from the day of the death. Probably
    due to a fall. Now, if you want let me go back to my occupations, i\u2019ll try
    to be grateful to you."
  - Wallace, your kindness will get you. Thank you for your help !

    have half of his talent. You should go and talk to him."

    - he asks with a big smile"
  - Could you tell me if Marcus Blayton had some peculiar habits lately ?
  - "Well, it is not really a secret if I told you that Marcus Blayton had quite an
    unrestrained life. \u201CWhile money can\u2019t buy happiness, it certainly lets
    you choose your own form of misery.\u201D; it perfectly corresponds to his life.
    People said that you could have found him very often at the brothel on Darty street.
    A friend of yours manages this place, am I right? - Percy acquiesces. Besides,
    I was told at a reception that he was maintaining close relations with an odd
    man around Wood Street, quite a suspicious connection actually\u2026"
  - "Interesting\u2026 How was he with his relatives ?"
  - "Some of his friends told me he had an argument with his children about some supposed
    fortune that he would have made disappear. From what I know, it would be hidden
    somewhere in London but I don\u2019t know why he would do that. Concerning his
    wife, everybody knows he was unfaithful. Moreover, I shouldn\u2019t say this to
    you, but one of my friend saw him in a hotel the day before yesterday in lovely
    company and she was not his wife ..."
  - Do you know who is this lady, Walter ?
  - "No, I unfortunately don\u2019t. I know she\u2019s a tall blond-haired woman,
    that\u2019s all... I\u2019d love to know who is lucky enough to have spent a night
    with the great Marcus Blayton - he laughs."
  - I have a last question for you Walter. What was the overall atmosphere in the
    troupe ?
  - "I don\u2019t really know. All what I know is that Marcus was a bit of a pig and
    it didn\u2019t help to make the atmosphere warm during rehearsals. The producer
    apparently has problems to replenish his pockets. Some say Marcus\u2019 problems
    are responsible for this, but I ignore what they could be."
  - Thank you Walter, you helped me a lot, once more !
  - "It\u2019s always my pleasure to discuss with you Percy. I think I spoke too much,
    once again. - he laughs."

  - Do you know if Marcus had a drug addiction?
  - "Oh, you know, you will find many people to denigrate Marcus. That\u2019s true,
    he had sulphurous dispositions that could eventually cause some tensions with
    his colleagues who didn\u2019t know him well. But Marcus was a star, his talent
    allowed him to take the liberty of doing so I guess."

  - This is quite surprising. I have a trusty source that told me he used to go to
    the Grey Cat.
  - "Well done, you got me ! What a great detective you are. I\u2019m surprised that
    they entrusted you this simple case."
  - I think that the situation is much more complex than you think. There are too
    many people hiding things from me in this case to believe this suicide hypothesis.
    Now, answer my question please.
  - Your wish is my command. Marcus and I loved each other. At least at the beginning.
    I rapidly realized that he was concerned by other ladies.
  - How did you react ?
  - "Well, I think I expected it and finally accepted it. I must say I didn\u2019t
    deprived myself on my side."
  - "Why didn\u2019t you separate ?"
  - This is a very good question I asked myself many times. At the beginning, I stayed
    for the children. Then, when they grew up, I think I was used to it and it became
    our way of life. Moreover, Marcus let me take advantage of his fortune.

    you too long, but I\u2019m trying to solve a case. Have you by any chance heard
    something about the actor Marcus Blayton who died yesterday?"
  - Good morning Percy, I would be glad to answer your questions, but usually you
    are more convincing. Did you forget my habits?
  - For you Walter, newspaper and your doughnuts, is it good for you ?
  - "Yes, of course Percy, I knew you\u2019d have come back. As you may know, I\u2019m
    acquainted with every little gossip of the town. What would you like to know?
    - he asks with a big smile"
  - Could you tell me if Marcus Blayton had some peculiar habits lately ?
  - "Well, it is not really a secret if I told you that Marcus Blayton had quite an
    unrestrained life. \u201CWhile money can\u2019t buy happiness, it certainly lets
    you choose your own form of misery.\u201D; it perfectly corresponds to his life.
    People said that you could have found him very often at the brothel on Darty street.
    A friend of yours manages this place, am I right? - Percy acquiesces. Besides,
    I was told at a reception that he was maintaining close relations with an odd
    man around Wood Street, quite a suspicious connection actually\u2026"
  - "Interesting\u2026 How was he with his relatives ?"
  - "Some of his friends told me he had an argument with his children about some supposed
    fortune that he would have made disappear. From what I know, it would be hidden
    somewhere in London but I don\u2019t know why he would do that. Concerning his
    wife, everybody knows he was unfaithful. Moreover, I shouldn\u2019t say this to
    you, but one of my friend saw him in a hotel the day before yesterday in lovely
    company and she was not his wife ..."
  - Do you know who is this lady, Walter ?
  - "No, I unfortunately don\u2019t. I know she\u2019s a tall blond-haired woman,
    that\u2019s all... I\u2019d love to know who is lucky enough to have spent a night
    with the great Marcus Blayton - he laughs."
  - I have a last question for you Walter. What was the overall atmosphere in the
    troupe ?
  - "I don\u2019t really know. All what I know is that Marcus was a bit of a pig and
    it didn\u2019t help to make the atmosphere warm during rehearsals. The producer
    apparently has problems to replenish his pockets. Some say Marcus\u2019 problems
    are responsible for this, but I ignore what they could be."
  - Thank you Walter, you helped me a lot, once more !
  - "It\u2019s always my pleasure to discuss with you Percy. I think I spoke too much,
    once again. - he laughs."

    you must believe me that I\u2019m deeply sorry. But I need to know if you have
    any idea of who could have killed your father. Moreover, pardon me for being so
    straight, but you understand that many clues go against you. You are celebrating
    your father\u2019s death the day after he died. Your father that you despised
    after what he did to you and your family, moreover you wanted him dead. So what
    can you say in your defence ?"
  - "Let me explain you why I didn\u2019t kill my father. I\u2019ve simply wiped him
    from my life for 11 years now. He was already dead to me. You know, Marcus Blayton
    had so many enemies that I wouldn\u2019t have risked to get my hands dirty, I
    knew that somebody else would do it for me\u2026 Moreover, if you want to know
    everything, I was at the United Club, it\u2019s a gentlemen's club on Charles
    street."
  - I note. Thank you for your cooperation.

  - Yes, you do not. So I guess that if you came here, you must have a very good reason.
    How can I help you ?
  - "I\u2019m investigating on the death of Marcus Blayton, the actor. Do you know
    him ?"
  - "Mmmmh. This name doesn\u2019t sound like unknown to me. But our clients don\u2019t
    reveal their identities. Do you have a picture of this man ?"
  - "No, I\u2019ll get you that."
  - Good. You know where I am.

    my wife bought two tickets to attend his performance. When I told her what happened
    I noted her disappointment by looking into her eyes."
  - "It\u2019s terribly sad indeed. Could you share some details with me about this
    case ?"
  - "There isn\u2019t too much to say actually. Given the circumstances, it\u2019s
    about suicide. If you go and see Wallace, our beloved coroner, I\u2019m sure he
    will tell you it\u2019s not. Beware of this insane man. Don\u2019t forget that
    he talks with dead people\u2026 Blayton certainly wasn\u2019t able to handle the
    pressure due to the tour and decided to end his life. What better way for an artist
    than dying on stage, which is actually not surprising for someone like Marcus
    Blayton, this man loved to catch everyone\u2019s attention. The only incongruity
    in this scenario is the absence of a goodbye note intended for his relatives,
    but hey you know, actors and their unexpected whims\u2026 To my mind, this case
    is a bit too simple for great detective Percy White. - he smiles"
  - I see. I truly thank you for your informations Arthur. Give your wife my regards.
  - "I certainly will ! It\u2019s always an enjoyment to help your in your investigations.
    I like to think I\u2019m a little bit responsible when you solve your cases. -
    he laughs"
  - No doubt Arthur. See you soon.

  - You mentioned some animosity between both lead actors. When was their last altercation
    ?
  - I might have heard them arguing yesterday, while other actors were ending the
    rehearsals. It was about an hour before the troupe went to have dinner in town.
  - "You didn\u2019t go with them ?"
  - No, I had to fix the curtain opening mechanism as soon as possible.

    this sort of events. We, the actors, and the technical crew were present. Edward
    Norrington wasn\u2019t there neither, he stopped rehearsing around 4pm then he
    left the theatre just an hour after. Actually he seemed a little tense. The producer
    Jonathan Cole didn\u2019t come to the dinner neither, he arrived while we were
    getting ready to go on stage, as he is used to. Oh, and Miles didn\u2019t come
    with us, he was repairing the curtain."

    him for at least 3 months. Girls say that he found the true love."
  - Interesting. Did he come regularly ?
  - Oooh yes ! He was one of our best clients. He could have made run our business
    alone at that time.
  - Do you remember when he used to visit the place ?
  - Yes, it was some years ago. I think he was just getting married. Poor lady ...

    the situation of the company, I had to favour the success of the play, that\u2019s
    why I made this choice."
  - Was the relationship between both actors good ? Did they know they were competing
    ?
  - Yes, they did. I invited them to discuss about it and to announce my choice. I
    must confess that the atmosphere during the diner was a bit tensed but I expected
    that. I finally calmed them down and everything returned to normal. At least this
    is what I thought until what happened yesterday ...

    of his  fortune. Do you know anything about that ?"
  - "It was probably not a lot of money, given his way of life \u2026 My mother and
    I tried to find it, it belongs to us."
  - What do you mean ?
  - Yes, it comes down to my sister and I. Given the way he treated us, he owes it
    to us, at least.
  - Money as forgiveness. Is it your point of view ?
  - "Call it as you want\u2026 But you must know that I could never forgive him. It\u2019s
    actually more like an indemnification."
  - I see. The time had come for Marcus to disappear before his money does the same
    ?
  - What do you have in mind Mr. White ?
  - "Nothing special, I\u2019m just investigating."
  - So please try to investigate on the right people.

    true."

    really treated the technical people like dirt.
  - Did you leave each other on good terms ?

    before the show began.

    where your father was found dead. Can you tell me if it belongs to you, and if

  - "Ah\u2026 I prefer not to speak about this detective."

    that you were on the crime scene, placing you as the main suspect. So you will
    tell me why, now."
  - "If you insist detective\u2026 But don\u2019t say anything to my brother, I beg
    you."
  - It will be our secret Ms. Blayton.
  - "The handkerchief is mine indeed. As you may know, the relationship between my
    father and my brother isn\u2019t the one a father and his son should have, and
    this has been for several years now. Robert had to assume our father\u2019s responsibilities
    and took care of our mother and me, he gave me everything and made me who I am
    now. Because of our father\u2019s behaviour, he forbade me to see him again. I
    haven\u2019t seen my father since many years now. I\u2019ve been trying to find
    him for a couple of weeks now, which was rather easy given his renown. As soon
    as I was told he was coming to London for a series of representations, I thought
    it was an opportunity for me to go and meet him so that he gives me an explanation.
    On Saturday I decided to go to the theatre, he was rehearsing his role. I discreetly
    slipped into the theatre and hid behind a curtain to watch him, but I was not
    able to go and talk to him at that moment. Then I saw his odious behaviour towards
    the other actors and the technical team, which revives me his absence when I was
    a child, and how he badly treated my mother and my brother the very short time
    he was at home. Past rose to the surface. I simply burst into tears. I was paralysed,
    then after a short time I ran away the fastest as I can to escape this place,
    and go far away from this man. This is the moment I probably lost my handkerchief,
    everything was so sudden\u2026 Once again Detective White, promise me you won\u2019t
    talk to Robert about this, it would devastate him."
  - "I give you my word Ms. Blayton. Thank you very much for your testimony, I guess
    it wasn\u2019t easy for you to live."

  - "I\u2019ve heard the relationship between your children and your deceased husband
    were not at their best. Can you confirm ?"
  - "Be careful to what you can hear or read detective. A man like you cannot be fooled
    by all those gossips, right ? Anyway, even if I hate newspapers, which only report
    gossips, I must confess that there\u2019s a part of truth about this. Our children
    felt abandoned by their father and they now feel some resentment, specially Robert,
    our son."

  - Your wife told us you had some money problems with the show ?
  - "Aaaah Rose, this kind of situation makes me realise how much she loves me. She\u2019s
    always preoccupied about me. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a big deal, these
    are just the typical problems we face at the beginning of a series of performances.
    Money is not the most important element in life, but friendship is, and I\u2019ve
    just lost one who was dear to me."

  sentences:
  - Did you plan to go somewhere the day after the last representation ?
  - "Yes, I did. My husband and I planned to spend some time in our little country
    house in the Kent, but don\u2019t tell him, it\u2019s a surprise. I want him to
    relax after a hard week at the theater. His job is a big source of pressure for
    him, particularly because of money problems he recently had."
  - "Are you sure ? After what you\u2019ve just told me about your relation with M.
    Blayton, I doubt about your honesty on this point."
  - "You\u2019re right, I lied. I can confess everything now that he\u2019s gone\u2026
    Marcus and I were about to leave. We wanted to start a new life together far away
    from this city. His career, his family, he was ready to abandon everything in
    the name of our love. He even planned to use what remained of his fortune to buy
    a house."
  - "His wife and his children mustn\u2019t have appreciated when they learnt their
    legacy disappeared ?"
  - Jane was upset but she finally accepted the situation. On the other hand, I think
    his son really took it the wrong way.
  - About your husband, did he know all of this ?
  - "I\u2019m not sure, I always had a doubt about him. Nevertheless, I\u2019m convinced
    he\u2019s known it for several days. His way to look at me has changed. Do you
    think my husband could have killed Marcus ?"
  - "I don\u2019t know Ms."

  - How would you consider the ambiance within the troupe ?
  - "We couldn\u2019t say the ambiance within the troupe was at the highest level
    of joy. To my mind, it was mostly due to Marcus who acted like a diva most of
    the time."

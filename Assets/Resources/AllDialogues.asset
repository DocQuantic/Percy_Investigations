  - I read in newspapers an interview of Marcus Blayton in which he says that the
    company was like a family. Is that true ?
  - "It wasn\u2019t all rosy. The actors don\u2019t feel affection for each other,
    the worst being Messrs Blayton and Norrington. Not a day went by without them
    yelling at each other. Mr Blayton was unpleasant with everyone here but Mrs Pitkins.
    I don\u2019t really know why."
  - You mentioned some animosity between both lead actors. When was their last altercation
    ?
  - I might have heard them arguing yesterday, while other actors were ending the
    rehearsals. It was about an hour before the troupe went to have dinner in town.
  - "You didn\u2019t go with them ?"
  - No, I had to fix the curtain opening mechanism as soon as possible.

    of joy. To my mind, it was mostly due to Marcus who acted like a diva most of
    the time."

  - Can you tell me about the ambiance within the troupe?
  - "It wasn\u2019t all rosy. The actors don\u2019t feel affection for each other,
    the worst being Messrs Blayton and Norrington. Not a day went by without them
    yelling at each other. Mr Blayton was unpleasant with everyone here but Mrs Pitkins.
    I don\u2019t really know why."
  - You mentioned some animosity between both lead actors. When was their last altercation
    ?
  - I might have heard them arguing yesterday, while other actors were ending the
    rehearsals. It was about an hour before the troupe went to have dinner in town.
  - "You didn\u2019t go with them ?"
  - No, I had to fix the curtain opening mechanism as soon as possible.

    this sort of events. We, the actors, and the technical crew were present. Edward
    Norrington wasn\u2019t there neither, he stopped rehearsing around 4pm then he
    left the theatre just an hour after. Actually he seemed a little tense. The producer
    Jonathan Cole didn\u2019t come to the dinner neither, he arrived while we were
    getting ready to go on stage, as he is used to. Oh, and Miles didn\u2019t come
    with us, he was repairing the curtain."

    before you raised the curtain ?
  - "Well, when I started to pull the rope, it was not as usual, as if there was a
    weight at the extremity or something obstructing it, I had to pull it with all
    my strength. Then M. Blayton\u2019s body fell from the sky. Now I understand why
    I had difficulties to open the curtain, the body probably got stuck with a part
    of the decor\u2026 Anyway, I saw many things in my entire life, but this is something
    quite striking !"

    for the representation, we had no room for error for the premi\xE8re ! But you
    know, the Royal Opera House has been under renovation for weeks, thus anyone who
    does not belong the theatre could have snaked in and out without being noticed.
    Anyone can currently waltz into the theatre as they please."

    didn\u2019t you?"

    asked me. He was a one-of-a-kind customer ! But he wasn\u2019t ordering so much
    lately. Money problems I think."
  - I see that you have the memory of a goldfish. How did you react when you realised
    Marcus was less and less using drugs?
  - "For sure I was angry first. But customers like him come and go. This is not a
    reason to kill him if it\u2019s what you have in mind."

    <Sentence character="Percy White" string="If he didn’t killed himself, someone else did. Any thoughts of someone who could have done such a thing ?"></Sentence>
    <Sentence character="Mary Pitkins" string="If you want my point of view, that mad man of a Norrington isn’t as pure as the driven snow. He was jealous of Marcus’ success because he didn’t have half of his talent. You should go and talk to him."></Sentence>
